The Angeles National Forest announced a new smaller closure zone caused by the damage from the Bobcat fire ([Bobcat Fire Closure Area Forest Order No. 05-01-22-02](https://www.facebook.com/angelesnationalforest/posts/284148300559401)).

To make the closure more understandable for trail crews and forest users, we at TrailAngeles digitized the map using CalTopo. Check it out here: <https://caltopo.com/m/KAD00>

Volunteer groups such as the [Lowelifes](https://trailangeles.org/volunteer-groups/lowelifes-respectable-citizens-club/), [Mt. Wilson Bicycling Association](https://trailangeles.org/volunteer-groups/mt-wilson-bicycling-association/) and [Bear Canyon Trail Crew](https://trailangeles.org/volunteer-groups/bearcanyontrailcrew/) are hard at work lately to reopen the damaged trails in the new closure zone.

All trail work in the Angeles National Forest and San Gabriel National Monument is performed by volunteer groups like these, please consider joining on one of their upcoming outings!
