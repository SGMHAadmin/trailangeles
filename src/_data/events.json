This educational sign will shed light on the <a href=\"https://lowelifesrcc.org/2021/08/23/robert-owens-and-el-prieto-canyon/\"><u>largely unknown story of Robert Owens</u></a>, a former enslaved person who became Los Angeles County’s wealthiest African American during the 19<sup>th</sup> century.</p><p>At 9am on June 19<sup>th</sup>, participants will be guided to hike ~1 mile from the <a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/HcXx82tQ8PvsXUmo7\"><u>JPL Riparian Zone Parking Area</u></a> to the lower entrance of <a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/HLwPWLPdwteXeros6\"><u>El Prieto Trail</u></a>. A 30-minute presentation on Robert Owen’s story and the history of the sign project will begin on-site at 9:30am.</p><p>Participants are recommended to wear sturdy shoes and carry a water bottle. The El Prieto Canyon area is not easily accessible to those with limited mobility. </p><p><em><i>According to Erik Hillard, Lowelifes Respectable Citizens Club:</i></em></p><blockquote><p><em><i>“</i></em>Unveiling the Robert Owens sign creates a permanent reminder of the hidden history within El Prieto Canyon. A new era acknowledges early African American settlers in our forest.”</p></blockquote><p><em><i>According to Veronica Jones, Altadena Historical Society:</i></em></p><blockquote><p><em><i></i></em>“Acknowledging the history of El Prieto Canyon helps our community to be stronger and brings us closer. We experience and learn about the history that guides us each day. ”</p></blockquote><p>Lowelifes Respectable Citizens Club acknowledges El Prieto Canyon is the home and traditional land belonging to the Gabrielino Tongva Nation.</p><p>For more information about the Robert Owens Project by Lowelifes Respectable Citizens Club, please visit: <a href=\"https://www.lowelifesrcc.org/robert-owens-el-prieto/\"><u>https://www.lowelifesrcc.org/robert-owens-el-prieto/</u></a></p>",
