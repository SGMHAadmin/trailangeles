Water that used to run across the trail now runs down the trail creating ruts. In a few places the vegetation did not burn and it is now infringing on the trail. We will cut this brush back, we will remove slough from the trail, we will remove the ruts and establish the proper slope on the trail so that it sheds the water before it runs down the trail creating these ruts.<br><br>You are welcome to volunteer for any day or days that you are available to attend.
