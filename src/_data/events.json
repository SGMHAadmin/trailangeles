TP (there are no bathrooms), strong garden GLOVES (suede leather type recommended) , sunscreen, sun hat, bandana. Dress for the weather!! In layers if it is cold.<br><br>Do Not Bring:<br>Dogs, as they get bored. Also, it would not be safe to bring young children (due to tools and trail is narrow).<br>Leave your garden tools at home, as we could damage them or lose them, and they are not appropriate for trail work.<br><br>Thank you for helping bring back this trail, so we can all enjoy it.<br><br>Leader: Dianne</p><p>Â </p><p>Dates: January 26</p><p>February 5, 13, 18, 21, 24, 26</p><u></u><u></u>",
