We request that volunteers attend both work days, and to entice you to commit we will provide a tasty dinner on Saturday night. The access to West Fork Campground along 2N24 is about 5.5 miles and 1,600 feet downhill from Red Box (Highway 2 at Mt Wilson Rd), so be ready to ride or hike that distance on Saturday morning and Sunday afternoon. Water is easily accessible from the campsite â€“ bring your filter. We supply the tools, safety gear, and training.",
