Help Dianne bring it back from being a bit overgrown after the last fire.<br><br>At this time we are restoring the beginning of the trail, closest to the trailhead. We will show you how to make/ maintain a trail. Get that special feeling of accomplishment as you work with other volunteers to complete manageable small outdoor projects (Trimming, trail brushing, and stashing trimmings). No heavy lifting etc. at this time. Work for a few hours, we will leave to come back early if it gets too hot/too cold/too windy/rainy or snowy.<br><br><b>Bring a mask if you cannot maintain social distancing.</b></p><p><b><br>PLEASE only RSVP</b>&nbsp;\"Yes\" if you can make it. Dianne will bring tools according to the RSVPs.<br>RSVP by emailing Dianne at Zuliebear@aol.com&nbsp;</p><p><br>Google Latitude/Longitude coordinates for the Meeting Spot (at Sand Canyon Road and 3N17) are 34.360824, -118.391941.<br><br><b>Directions to Meeting Spot (White Gate for 3N17):</b><br>Take the I-5 to the SR-14 North. Exit at Sand Canyon, turn right (South/East). Go all the way past all the houses, Placerita Canyon etc., going straight. Enter the Angeles National Forest and Monument and continue up!up!up! Sand Canyon Road until you see a memorial at a bad corner (on the right side). Shortly after this you will see a small brown sign \"Santa Clara Divide Road\". Park in one of the turnouts to the left, right, or above this sign but not blocking the white gate. Dianne will caravan you to the trail head.<br><br><b>Meeting Time:</b><br>We will meet at 7:45AM and depart for the trailhead no later than 8:00 AM SHARP.
