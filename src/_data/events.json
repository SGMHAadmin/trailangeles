This is your chance to convince volunteers that they should join your project, so be as detailed as possible.<br></b><br>Brush is infringing on the trail from Spunky Canyon, PCT Mile 471.5, south to the powerlines at mile 468.2. The brush is pushing hikers off the trail causing tread damage and trail creep. There is also significant slough and erosion in this section. The Trail Gorillas will cut the brush and remove it from the trail. We will also repair the tread where needed along this section.</article>",
